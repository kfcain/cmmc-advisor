## Overview

This file maps Microsoft 365 tenancy patterns to CMMC practice
requirements for defense contractors handling CUI or FCI. It is
the authoritative source in this corpus for the GCC versus GCC
High versus DoD tenancy-selection decision. Phase 5b's
`references/modern-it/endpoints/windows-fleet.md` carries a
compact pointer to this file for the full decision tree per hub
Decision 5.

Microsoft 365 government tenancies serve distinct audiences:

- **Commercial.** Public-sector and private-sector workloads;
  FedRAMP Moderate on specific services; DoD IL2 for non-CUI
  federal. Not appropriate for CUI under DFARS 7012.
- **GCC (Government Community Cloud).** Federal agencies and
  contractors handling public-sector workloads up to FedRAMP
  Moderate and DoD IL2. CUI posture is limited; contract clauses
  may allow GCC for specific CUI scenarios with agency
  agreement, but GCC High is the common contractor path for
  DFARS-scope CUI.
- **GCC High (Government Community Cloud High).** Defense
  contractors, IL4 and IL5 workloads, DFARS 7012 CUI handling,
  ITAR-controlled environments. Sovereign tenancy physically
  and logically separate from commercial Microsoft 365.
- **DoD.** Department of Defense mission-owner workloads.
  Reserved for DoD consumption; contractors typically do not
  land here directly but may interact with DoD tenants through
  cross-tenant collaboration.

Read this file alongside
`references/modern-it/productivity/README.md` (the Phase 5d hub
carrying the seven conventions including the canonical
capability-appendix format), the Phase 5c cloud-platforms hub
(`references/modern-it/cloud-platforms/cloud-selection.md`) for
the FedRAMP-to-IL crosswalk under CSP SRG v1r1, and
`references/modern-it/cloud-platforms/azure-government.md` for
the Azure IaaS and platform services that M365 GCC High runs
on top of.

**FedRAMP authorization summary (verified 2026-04-21).**
Microsoft Office 365 GCC High holds a FedRAMP High JAB
Provisional Authority to Operate under the Microsoft Office
365 GCC High package (MSO365MT on
marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/MSO365MT). Microsoft Office
365 GCC holds a separate FedRAMP Moderate authorization.
Microsoft Office 365 Commercial holds a FedRAMP High P-ATO on
specific services. Per-service authorization (which specific
Office 365 workloads are in FedRAMP scope within each tenancy)
is enumerated on the FedRAMP Marketplace package pages; verify
at marketplace.fedramp.gov before citing specific package
identifiers in an SSP.

**DoD Impact Level coverage (verified 2026-04-21).** Microsoft
365 GCC holds DoD IL2 Provisional Authorization. Microsoft 365
GCC High holds DoD IL2, IL4, and IL5 Provisional Authorizations
under CSP SRG v1r1 reciprocity rules: IL5 on FedRAMP High
baseline plus CNSSI 1253 High Confidentiality and Integrity
overlays. Microsoft 365 DoD (the DoD-exclusive tenancy) holds
IL5 under separate provisional authorization.

## Scope of this file

Covered:

- Microsoft 365 commercial, GCC, GCC High, and DoD tenancy
  posture for defense contractors handling CUI or FCI.
- Tenancy and subscription model; identity plane (Entra ID
  Government, Conditional Access, PIM); productivity core
  (Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive for Business,
  Teams); endpoint management plane (Intune); compliance and
  governance (Microsoft Purview); security operations (Defender
  for Office 365, Defender for Endpoint); Power Platform.
- CMMC practice mapping per capability cluster.
- Evidence-collection patterns.
- Common mistakes specific to M365 government tenancies.
- ITAR story for GCC High, distinct from Google Workspace
  Assured Controls Plus (see `google-workspace.md`).

Not covered:

- Azure IaaS and platform services. Those live in
  `references/modern-it/cloud-platforms/azure-government.md`.
  M365 GCC High and Azure Government are separate tenancies
  that interoperate; the Azure file handles platform posture,
  this file handles productivity posture.
- Endpoint configuration detail for Windows fleets under Intune.
  Capability-to-practice mapping for Windows endpoints lives in
  `references/modern-it/endpoints/windows-fleet.md`.
- Microsoft 365 DoD tenancy in implementation depth. The DoD
  tenancy is for DoD mission owners; contractors interact with
  DoD tenants through cross-tenant collaboration rather than
  landing there directly.
- Microsoft 365 Copilot and generative-AI features. Productivity
  AI features carry separate FedRAMP scope considerations
  covered under `references/modern-it/ai-services/`.
- Pre-2016 legacy offerings (Office 365 E3 Government, older
  GCC naming). The current GCC / GCC High / DoD taxonomy is
  the authoritative one.

## Tenancy Selection

Per hub Decision 3, this section answers three questions in
order. This is the authoritative decision tree for Microsoft
365 tenancy selection; Phase 5b's `windows-fleet.md` carries a
compact pointer here.

**1. Is Microsoft 365 Commercial ever acceptable for CUI?** No.
Commercial M365 holds FedRAMP High on specific services but
does not meet the DoD IL4/IL5 operator-access restrictions
that CSP SRG v1r1 imposes for CUI. Commercial is appropriate
for non-CUI federal workloads or non-federal workloads but
must not host CUI subject to DFARS 252.204-7012. A contractor
running CUI in Commercial M365 has a scope problem, not a
tuning problem; the path forward is a migration to GCC High
(or Workspace Assured Controls Plus) rather than
configuration tightening.

**2. Which government tenancy is the contractor path: GCC,
GCC High, or DoD?**

- **GCC** is FedRAMP Moderate plus DoD IL2. Appropriate for
  federal agency non-CUI work and contractor workloads where
  the contract specifies FedRAMP Moderate equivalence without
  IL4/IL5 overlay requirements. Some agencies accept GCC for
  limited CUI scenarios under specific contract language;
  verify with the Contracting Officer before assuming.
- **GCC High** is FedRAMP High plus DoD IL5 (with IL4
  inheriting). Appropriate for DFARS 7012 CUI, ITAR-controlled
  technical data, IL5 mission-critical workloads, and the
  typical defense-contractor scenario. Sovereign tenancy
  physically and logically separate from commercial M365;
  Microsoft operator access restricted to screened US-persons.
  This is the common defense-contractor path.
- **DoD** is IL5 plus DoD-exclusive infrastructure reserved for
  Department of Defense mission owners. Contractors typically
  interact with DoD tenants as external collaborators rather
  than as primary tenants.

**Regulatory mechanics behind the default recommendation.**
DFARS 252.204-7012(b)(2)(ii)(D) requires FedRAMP Moderate
equivalence for CSPs handling CUI; GCC Moderate satisfies that
equivalence on its face. The common-contractor preference for
GCC High rests on two operational considerations rather than
statutory requirement: (1) several DoD contract vehicles and
flow-downs explicitly reference DoD IL5, which GCC High
directly carries while GCC does not, and (2) enforcement
against future regulatory tightening is easier from the higher
tenancy (a contract that tightens from Moderate-equivalent to
IL5 mid-performance is more disruptive for a GCC contractor
than for a GCC High contractor). The tenancy decision belongs
in a tenancy-selection workflow informed by contract-vehicle
language, not in an endpoint-posture default.

**Management-plane tenancy inheritance.** The tenancy choice
drives what inheritance the contractor can claim for
management-plane control surfaces (Intune for endpoint
management, Defender for Endpoint for EDR, Purview for
compliance). A management plane running in GCC High inherits
the GCC High FedRAMP High P-ATO plus IL5 PA; a management
plane running in GCC inherits FedRAMP Moderate plus IL2. The
productivity-suite tenancy and the management-plane tenancy
must match. Splitting them (for example, M365 GCC High for
productivity but Intune GCC for endpoint management) is not
supported and creates an inheritance-mismatch scope problem.

The default recommendation for a defense contractor handling
CUI under DFARS 7012 is GCC High. GCC is a viable choice only
when the contract explicitly accepts FedRAMP Moderate
equivalence and the workload does not trigger IL4/IL5 overlay
requirements.

**3. What workload-location and support-personnel-citizenship
boundaries apply inside the chosen tenancy?**

- **GCC:** US data residency; Microsoft operator personnel
  with US-based screening; support cases routed through
  government-tenancy channels.
- **GCC High:** US data residency enforced at the sovereign-
  tenancy boundary; Microsoft operator personnel are
  screened US-persons (citizens, US nationals, or US-persons
  as defined under CSP SRG v1r1); support cases handled by
  US-person personnel in the government-tenancy support
  infrastructure. ITAR-controlled technical data is an
  established use case.
- **DoD:** US data residency; DoD-specific personnel controls
  layered on top of GCC High equivalent posture; support
  handled by DoD-cleared Microsoft personnel.

The contractor-side personnel posture is distinct from the
Microsoft-side posture. A non-US-person contractor employee
cannot serve as a Microsoft support escalation contact in GCC
High, and may or may not be permitted to administer the
contractor's own M365 tenancy depending on the contract's
export-control terms. If ITAR-controlled or EAR-controlled
technical data is present, US-person-only staffing may apply
to the contractor side as well; consult export-control counsel
before finalizing personnel policy.

---

## Tenancy and subscription model

**Capability.** A Microsoft 365 tenancy is the top-level unit
of isolation; each tenancy has a unique domain
(`contoso.onmicrosoft.us` for GCC High) and distinct identity,
licensing, and service-scope boundaries. Within a tenancy,
Microsoft 365 licenses provision service entitlements per user
(Office 365 E5 GCC High, Microsoft 365 E5 GCC High, and
similar bundles). The same corporate entity may operate
multiple M365 tenancies (for example, a commercial tenancy for
non-CUI work plus a GCC High tenancy for CUI work); cross-tenancy
collaboration uses guest-account federation patterns.

**CMMC practices implemented.** CM.L2-3.4.1 (baseline
configuration), CM.L2-3.4.2 (configuration enforcement),
AC.L2-3.1.3 (CUI flow control at tenancy boundaries), and
AC.L2-3.1.5 (least privilege at the tenancy administrative
role level).

**Implementation notes.**

- Operate separate commercial and GCC High tenancies when the
  organization has both non-CUI work and CUI work. Merging the
  two into one tenancy is not technically possible at the
  service-plane level; the tenancies are architecturally
  distinct.
- License administration happens through the Microsoft 365
  admin portal for the tenancy. GCC High licensing is priced
  separately from commercial and is sold through specific
  authorized reseller channels; verify reseller status before
  purchasing.
- Use tenant-level settings (Global Administrator scope) as a
  last-resort emergency pattern; delegate day-to-day
  administration through specific roles (User Administrator,
  Compliance Administrator, SharePoint Administrator, Teams
  Administrator, Security Administrator, Exchange
  Administrator) with PIM just-in-time activation.
- Cross-tenant collaboration between GCC High and commercial
  or between GCC High and other GCC High tenants uses the B2B
  guest-account pattern plus Entra External ID Government
  configuration. The cross-tenant identity federation must be
  documented in the SSP.

**Evidence to collect.**

- Tenancy registration documentation showing the tenancy's
  GCC High designation.
- License inventory showing service entitlements per user.
- Admin role assignments documentation (via PIM or equivalent).
- Cross-tenant federation configuration if applicable.

**Common mistakes.**

- Provisioning a single commercial tenancy with the intent to
  "add a GCC High overlay later." The overlay does not exist;
  GCC High is a separate tenancy.
- Using Global Administrator for day-to-day operations. Role
  sprawl and blast-radius concerns make this a common
  assessment finding.
- Cross-tenancy federation without Conditional Access policies
  on the guest-account plane. External users accessing CUI
  require the same MFA and posture enforcement as internal
  users.

---

## Identity and access management

**Capability.** Microsoft Entra ID Government is the identity
service for GCC High tenancies (formerly Azure AD Government).
Entra ID Government supports Conditional Access policies
(session-level risk-based enforcement), Privileged Identity
Management (just-in-time role activation with approval
workflows), multi-factor authentication enforcement, external
identity federation (SAML, OIDC, SCIM), and hybrid identity
through Entra Connect from on-premises Active Directory.

**CMMC practices implemented.** IA.L2-3.5.1 (user
identification), IA.L2-3.5.2 (user authentication),
IA.L2-3.5.3 (MFA), IA.L2-3.5.4 (replay-resistant
authentication), AC.L2-3.1.1 (account management),
AC.L2-3.1.5 (least privilege), AC.L2-3.1.7 (privileged
function logging through PIM activation events), and
AC.L2-3.1.8 (unsuccessful logon attempts through Conditional
Access lockout).

**Implementation notes.**

- Workforce identity for CUI workloads must live in an Entra
  ID Government tenant, not in a commercial Entra ID tenant
  federated into Government. The identity plane is a CUI
  attack surface; CUI-capable workloads require a CUI-capable
  identity plane.
- Conditional Access policies should require phishing-
  resistant MFA (FIDO2 security keys, Windows Hello for
  Business, or certificate-based authentication) for
  privileged actions and for all CUI-scope applications.
  SMS-based MFA is deprecated by NIST SP 800-63B for
  Authenticator Assurance Level 2 and should not be the sole
  factor for CUI access.
- PIM for Entra ID roles, Azure roles, and PIM for Groups
  delivers just-in-time privileged access. Standing privileged
  assignments should be the exception, not the default.
- Hybrid identity patterns: Entra Connect synchronizes from
  on-premises Active Directory to Entra ID Government. For
  contractors with existing on-prem AD handling CUI identity,
  Entra Connect is the typical integration path; the on-prem
  AD becomes an in-scope identity source. This pulls on-prem
  AD infrastructure (domain controllers, directory databases,
  replication traffic) into CMMC scope for AC, AU, IA, and
  SC practice evidence; the on-prem AD must be documented as
  a CUI-adjacent asset in the SSP and hardened accordingly
  (domain controller patching under SI.L2-3.14.1, AD audit
  logging under AU.L2-3.3.1, privileged group monitoring).
- Entra External ID Government handles B2B guest access to
  CUI resources. Guest users require the same MFA and
  Conditional Access posture as members.

**Evidence to collect.**

- Entra ID Government tenant configuration showing the
  directory location (Government cloud) and identity provider
  configuration.
- Conditional Access policy export with MFA and session-
  control policies applied to CUI scope.
- PIM role assignment inventory (just-in-time vs permanent).
- Authentication methods policy showing phishing-resistant
  methods enforced.
- Sign-in log sample from Entra ID forwarded to the SIEM.

**Common mistakes.**

- Federating Entra ID Government against a commercial IdP for
  primary workforce identity. The CUI boundary extends into
  the commercial IdP; this undoes the GCC High tenancy
  isolation.
- Using SMS or phone-call MFA as the primary factor. Phishing-
  resistant methods are the assessor-preferred default.
- Granting standing Global Administrator to staff. PIM-
  eligible-only is the default; standing assignment is a
  deliberate exception with documented justification.

## Productivity core: Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Teams

**Capability.** The productivity core of M365 GCC High
comprises Exchange Online (email, calendar, distribution
lists); SharePoint Online (site collections, document
libraries, intranet); OneDrive for Business (per-user file
storage and synchronization); and Microsoft Teams (persistent
chat, channels, meetings, calls, file sharing integrated with
SharePoint and OneDrive). Each service ships in the GCC High
tenancy with distinct authorization scope documented at the
FedRAMP Marketplace package (MSO365MT).

**CMMC practices implemented.** AC.L2-3.1.3 (CUI flow control
between services), AC.L2-3.1.18 (mobile device connection
control for Outlook mobile, Teams mobile, SharePoint mobile),
SC.L2-3.13.8 (transmission confidentiality and integrity),
SC.L2-3.13.11 (FIPS-validated cryptography at rest),
SC.L2-3.13.16 (data at rest encryption), AU.L2-3.3.1 (audit
event creation), AU.L2-3.3.2 (user accountability).

**Implementation notes.**

- Exchange Online Protection (EOP) and Defender for Office 365
  provide anti-phishing, anti-malware, and attachment scanning
  for email. Defender for Office 365 is the CUI-expected tier
  for CMMC L2 because the threat environment includes phishing
  and supply-chain email attacks.
- SharePoint Online and OneDrive inherit tenant-level sharing
  policies. Configure the external sharing policy to "New and
  existing guests" or tighter; "Anyone" (anonymous link
  sharing) is not appropriate for CUI-scope site collections.
  Sensitivity labels (Purview) enforce encryption and
  access-control at the document level for CUI.
- Teams channels are backed by SharePoint (team sites) and
  OneDrive (private chat files). CUI shared in Teams chat
  inherits the SharePoint/OneDrive boundary. Private-channel
  and shared-channel patterns have different isolation
  properties; verify channel type before designating CUI
  containers.
- Per-service authorization status for each of these services
  in GCC High is at the FedRAMP Marketplace package MSO365MT.
  Not every feature enhancement ships with FedRAMP
  authorization at GA; verify the specific feature
  authorization before relying on it for CUI.

**Evidence to collect.**

- Exchange Online transport rule inventory showing CUI-relevant
  policies (external-sender warning, DLP policies, retention).
- SharePoint external sharing policy configuration export.
- OneDrive tenant sharing policy configuration export.
- Teams governance policy export (guest access, external
  access, messaging policies).
- Defender for Office 365 policy inventory (Safe Attachments,
  Safe Links, anti-phishing, anti-spam).

**Common mistakes.**

- Allowing Anyone (anonymous) sharing links on SharePoint or
  OneDrive in a CUI-scope tenant. Default tenant setting must
  be restricted for CUI.
- Treating Teams persistent chat as ephemeral. Chat messages
  are retained per the tenant's retention policy; CUI shared
  in chat is subject to retention, DLP, and eDiscovery.
- Running Commercial Exchange Online for email while running
  GCC High for files. Email is a common CUI egress path; the
  whole productivity core should live in one tenancy.

---

## Endpoint management plane: Intune

**Capability.** Microsoft Intune in the GCC High tenancy
manages Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android endpoints through
the MDM and MAM protocols. Intune delivers configuration
profiles, compliance policies, application protection
policies, app deployment, Autopilot provisioning, and
integration with Defender for Endpoint. Intune GCC High is
separate from Intune Commercial and Intune GCC; tenancy
selection for endpoint management must match the productivity
tenancy.

**CMMC practices implemented.** CM.L2-3.4.1 (baseline
configuration), CM.L2-3.4.2 (configuration enforcement),
CM.L2-3.4.6 (least functionality), and AC.L2-3.1.18 (mobile
device connection control). See also
`references/modern-it/endpoints/windows-fleet.md` and
`references/modern-it/endpoints/macos-fleet.md` for the
endpoint-side capability-to-practice mapping.

**Implementation notes.**

- Intune tenancy must match the productivity tenancy. An
  organization running M365 GCC High for productivity but
  Intune Commercial for endpoint management has a scope
  problem: the commercial Intune tenancy is not
  CUI-authorized and cannot manage CUI endpoints.
- Intune Administrator roles are separate from M365 Admin
  Center roles and from Entra ID roles. Apply PIM to Intune
  role assignments.
- Configuration Service Provider (CSP) policy names evolve
  across Windows feature updates; verify against the current
  Microsoft Learn CSP reference before deploying. See
  `references/modern-it/endpoints/windows-fleet.md` for the
  policy-key rot-protection convention.
- Compliance policies feed Conditional Access device-state
  evaluation. A device must be Intune-enrolled and compliant
  before Conditional Access grants access to CUI workloads;
  this is the endpoint-identity integration pattern.
- Per-service Intune GCC High authorization scope is
  enumerated at marketplace.fedramp.gov under the Microsoft
  Office 365 GCC High package (MSO365MT) and Microsoft Learn
  Intune documentation. Not every Intune feature or
  configuration service provider (CSP) policy in commercial
  Intune ships simultaneously in GCC High; verify specific
  feature authorization before relying on it for CUI
  workloads. Third-party EDR or MDM agents operating alongside
  or in place of Intune on CUI endpoints must terminate their
  management plane in a government tenancy; a third-party agent
  reporting into a commercial SaaS backend pulls the management
  plane out of the GCC High authorization scope.

**Evidence to collect.**

- Intune tenancy assignment documentation (GCC High).
- Device inventory report from Intune showing every enrolled
  endpoint's compliance state.
- Configuration profile export showing CUI-scope baselines.
- Conditional Access policies that reference Intune
  compliance state.

**Common mistakes.**

- Running Intune Commercial alongside GCC High productivity.
  The management plane must match the productivity tenancy.
- Assuming Intune Administrator role grants Entra ID directory
  access. The role scopes are distinct; separate privileges
  apply.

## Compliance and governance: Microsoft Purview

**Capability.** Microsoft Purview (formerly Microsoft 365
Compliance) is the unified compliance platform covering
Data Loss Prevention (DLP), Sensitivity Labels, Retention
Policies
and Labels, Records Management, eDiscovery (Standard and
Premium), Compliance Manager, Communication Compliance,
Information Barriers, and Insider Risk Management. Purview
operates within the M365 tenancy; Purview in GCC High carries
the GCC High tenancy's authorization scope.

**CMMC practices implemented.** AC.L2-3.1.3 (CUI flow control
through DLP), MP.L2-3.8.1 (media marking through sensitivity
labels), MP.L2-3.8.2 (media access restriction through label-
based encryption), AU.L2-3.3.1 (audit event creation),
AU.L2-3.3.2 (user accountability), AU.L2-3.3.5 (audit
correlation through eDiscovery), and CA.L2-3.12.3 (continuous
monitoring through Compliance Manager).

**Implementation notes.**

- Sensitivity Labels are the primary CUI-marking mechanism in
  M365. Create labels aligned with the CUI categories in the
  contractor's scope (for example, "CUI", "CUI//SP-PROPIN",
  "CUI//SP-EXPT"). Labels can auto-apply via content
  inspection, enforce encryption through Azure Rights
  Management, and travel with the document across Exchange,
  SharePoint, OneDrive, and Teams.
- DLP policies detect CUI content in transit (outgoing email,
  external sharing, Teams chat) and block or warn. Start with
  Microsoft-provided CUI-adjacent policy templates and tune
  for the contractor's specific CUI categories.
- Retention Policies enforce the contractor's records-retention
  schedule. CUI typically has longer retention than non-CUI;
  configure retention policies scoped to CUI-labeled content.
- eDiscovery Premium is required for legal-hold workflows on
  CUI. Verify the tenancy's eDiscovery license tier includes
  Premium before relying on it for legal-hold response.
- Compliance Manager provides a scored view of Microsoft-vs-
  customer responsibility per regulatory control. Useful as
  an SSP starting point for inherited controls; not a
  substitute for the contractor's own SSP narrative. See
  `references/modern-it/cloud-platforms/azure-government.md`
  "Microsoft Compliance Manager overlay" for the treatment
  also applicable here.

**Evidence to collect.**

- Sensitivity label configuration export showing CUI labels
  and their encryption and access policies.
- DLP policy inventory showing CUI-detection rules.
- Retention policy configuration scoped to CUI content.
- Compliance Manager assessment export for CMMC Level 2 and
  FedRAMP High, dated.
- Sample eDiscovery case record demonstrating the workflow.

**Common mistakes.**

- Configuring sensitivity labels in the portal but not
  publishing them to a label policy. Created-but-unpublished
  labels are invisible to users.
- Relying on DLP policies without sensitivity labels. DLP can
  detect content patterns (SSN, credit-card, explicit CUI
  markings) but cannot detect contractor-specific CUI content
  categories without a labeling signal.
- Treating Compliance Manager's Microsoft-side attestations
  as completed SSP narrative. Customer-side implementation
  detail remains the contractor's authorship.

## Security operations: Defender for Office 365 and Defender for Endpoint

**Capability.** Microsoft Defender for Office 365 provides
anti-phishing, anti-malware, Safe Attachments, Safe Links,
and attack simulation for Exchange Online, SharePoint,
OneDrive, and Teams. Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE)
provides endpoint detection and response (EDR), next-
generation antivirus, threat intelligence, and vulnerability
management for Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android
endpoints. Both ship in GCC High as separate service
instances from commercial Defender; cross-tenancy data is not
supported.

**CMMC practices implemented.** SI.L2-3.14.2 (malicious code
protection), SI.L2-3.14.4 (update malicious code mechanisms),
SI.L2-3.14.5 (periodic and real-time scanning), SI.L2-3.14.3
(security alerts and advisories), SI.L2-3.14.6 (system
monitoring), and SI.L2-3.14.7 (unauthorized use detection).

**Implementation notes.**

- Defender for Office 365 Plan 2 includes Attack Simulation
  and Threat Explorer; Plan 1 is more limited. For CMMC L2
  CUI workflows, Plan 2 is the expected tier.
- Defender for Endpoint tenancy must match the productivity
  tenancy. An MDE Commercial instance cannot cover GCC High
  endpoints; the CUI telemetry must terminate in the GCC
  High tenancy.
- Tamper Protection must be enabled. It prevents local
  administrators from disabling Defender components; this is
  an assessor-typical finding when disabled.
- Telemetry export from Defender to a SIEM handles AU.L2-3.3.5
  correlation. Microsoft Sentinel in Azure Government is the
  natural SIEM pairing; third-party SIEMs ingest via Defender
  APIs.
- Defender Antivirus and a third-party EDR cannot both run in
  active mode simultaneously; configure passive mode for
  Defender when a third-party EDR is the primary.

**Evidence to collect.**

- Defender for Office 365 policy configuration (Safe
  Attachments, Safe Links, anti-phishing policies) exported.
- Defender for Endpoint onboarding status showing every
  managed endpoint is reporting with current signatures.
- Tamper Protection enforcement configuration.
- SIEM forwarding configuration and sample alert record.

**Common mistakes.**

- Leaving Tamper Protection off because it "breaks a tool."
  The assessor expects it on for CUI endpoints.
- Running Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 and assuming it
  covers the SI.L2-3.14.6 monitoring scope. Plan 2 is the
  defensible CMMC L2 tier.
- Crossing tenancy boundaries: Defender Commercial telemetry
  into a GCC High SIEM, or vice versa. Cross-tenancy
  telemetry is not supported for CUI.

---

## Power Platform: Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI

**Capability.** Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI ship
in Power Platform GCC (FedRAMP Moderate + DoD IL2) and Power
Platform GCC High (FedRAMP High + DoD IL5) tenancies. Power
Platform tenancy selection must match the M365 productivity
tenancy for consistent CUI posture.

**CMMC practices implemented.** When Power Platform is used
for CUI workflows: AC.L2-3.1.3 (CUI flow control), CM.L2-3.4.1
(baseline configuration of data loss prevention policies at
the Power Platform environment level), CM.L2-3.4.2
(configuration enforcement through tenant-level Power
Platform policies), and AU.L2-3.3.1 (audit event creation
through Power Platform audit logs).

**Implementation notes.**

- Power Platform Environments are the primary unit of scope.
  Dedicate Production and Development environments to CUI
  workloads with DLP policies restricting connectors to
  CUI-approved services.
- Connectors to non-CUI services (commercial-Azure data
  sources, third-party SaaS without government tenancy)
  must be blocked at the environment level for CUI-scope
  apps.
- Power Platform GCC High runs on Azure Government
  infrastructure (see
  `references/modern-it/cloud-platforms/azure-government.md`)
  with the same tenancy posture as the rest of the M365 GCC
  High stack.
- Audit logs ship to the M365 Compliance audit log; forward
  to SIEM alongside Exchange and SharePoint audit data.

**Evidence to collect.**

- Power Platform tenant-level DLP policy export.
- Environment inventory showing CUI-scope environments and
  their connector policies.
- Audit log configuration for Power Platform.

**Common mistakes.**

- Allowing commercial-connector access from a CUI-scope Power
  Platform environment. The connector-boundary enforcement is
  the primary Power Platform DLP mechanism for CUI.
- Relying on connector DLP alone as the governance surface.
  Connector DLP prevents managed connectors from reaching
  non-approved services but does not prevent a user with
  environment-creator privileges from creating a new
  environment, nor does it prevent personal cloud flows
  reaching personal-account OneDrive or similar. Additional
  governance guardrails needed: restrict environment creation
  to delegated admins, disable personal cloud flows where
  CUI exposure is a concern, require admin approval for new
  custom connectors, and audit Power App and Flow creation
  through the Power Platform admin activity logs.
- Mixing Power Platform GCC (Moderate) environments with
  Power Platform GCC High (High) environments inside the
  same tenancy. Tenancy-tier consistency applies here as
  with the rest of the M365 stack.

## ITAR posture for GCC High

**Capability.** Microsoft 365 GCC High is the established
sovereign-tenancy answer for contractors handling
ITAR-controlled technical data through productivity workflows
(email, shared documents, Teams collaboration on ITAR-scope
engineering data). Microsoft's ITAR commitments for GCC High
rest on three load-bearing claims: US data residency at the
sovereign-tenancy level (customer data and metadata reside
in the United States), US-person operator access (Microsoft
personnel with access to customer data are screened
US-persons), and contractual language in the GCC High
agreement naming ITAR support.

**CMMC practices implemented.** This posture does not map to
a specific CMMC practice; ITAR is a separate regulatory
regime. The practices affected by ITAR posture are the same
ones affected by CUI posture (access control, encryption,
audit, personnel screening) but the ITAR overlay imposes
additional constraints on contractor personnel (US-person-
only staffing where ITAR data is present) that interact with
CMMC personnel screening under PS.L2-3.9.1 and PS.L2-3.9.2.

**Implementation notes.**

- ITAR posture applies to the contractor's full ITAR
  exposure, not just the productivity suite. ITAR-controlled
  data in email, SharePoint document libraries, Teams chat,
  and OneDrive all inherit the GCC High ITAR story.
- The contractor-side personnel posture is distinct from the
  Microsoft-side posture. Microsoft guarantees US-person
  operator access; the contractor is responsible for
  ensuring contractor-side access is limited to US-persons
  where ITAR applies. A non-US-person contractor employee
  with access to an ITAR-scope SharePoint site represents a
  contractor-side violation regardless of the tenancy's
  sovereign status.
- ITAR training for contractor personnel is required;
  Microsoft does not deliver this training. Integrate ITAR
  training into the contractor's AT program (see
  `references/domains/at-awareness-training.md`).
- ITAR is different from the EAR regime. If the workload
  carries EAR-controlled dual-use data, verify the EAR posture
  separately with export-control counsel; GCC High's ITAR
  story does not automatically cover EAR.
- Cross-tenancy collaboration with non-GCC High tenants
  (commercial Microsoft 365, non-Microsoft tenants) for
  ITAR-scope content requires explicit export-control review.
  Default posture: no cross-tenant sharing of ITAR data.

**Evidence to collect.**

- Microsoft GCC High agreement and contractual ITAR language.
- Contractor ITAR policy document naming US-person staffing
  requirements for ITAR-scope work.
- Personnel screening records for staff with ITAR-scope
  access.
- Cross-tenant sharing restriction documentation.

**Common mistakes.**

- Assuming GCC High's ITAR commitment extends to the
  contractor's personnel automatically. It does not; the
  contractor owns contractor-side ITAR personnel compliance.
- Treating ITAR and EAR as interchangeable. They are distinct
  regimes with different scopes and enforcement mechanisms.
- Cross-tenant collaboration on ITAR data without
  export-control review. A single B2B guest account on an
  ITAR-scope SharePoint site can create a violation.

## Support and operator-access posture

**Capability.** Microsoft 365 GCC High Support is handled by
screened US-person Microsoft personnel in the government-
tenancy support infrastructure. Support plans (Developer,
Standard, Professional Direct, Unified) apply separately in
GCC High from commercial; for CUI workloads, Professional
Direct or Unified is the typical tier for incident response
SLAs. Microsoft operator personnel with production access to
GCC High infrastructure are screened US-persons per CSP SRG
v1r1 Personnel Requirements.

**CMMC practices implemented.** PS.L2-3.9.1 (personnel
screening) and PS.L2-3.9.2 (personnel transfer) are inherited
from Microsoft for the Microsoft-operator side; the
contractor still owns these practices for contractor personnel.
SR (Supply Chain Risk Management) controls inherit from
Microsoft under the FedRAMP authorization.

**Implementation notes.**

- Support cases must not include CUI data in case descriptions
  or attachments. Microsoft support handles FedRAMP-scope
  cases; case-data sanitization is the contractor's
  responsibility.
- Compliance Manager and the Service Trust Portal provide
  downloadable Microsoft attestations for inherited controls.
  Use these to support SSP inheritance narrative.
- The Microsoft US-person operator-access posture applies at
  the tenancy level. Contractor personnel posture is a
  separate export-control and contract question; see ITAR
  section above.

**Evidence to collect.**

- GCC High support plan documentation per tenancy.
- Support case hygiene policy naming the CUI-scrubbing
  requirement before submission.
- Microsoft SSP sections downloaded from Service Trust Portal
  for personnel-screening inheritance.

**Common mistakes.**

- Attaching CUI logs or production data to Support cases
  without sanitization.
- Using commercial Microsoft 365 Support case URLs or
  escalation contacts for GCC High issues.

## FedRAMP and Impact Level posture

**FedRAMP status (verified 2026-04-21).**

- Microsoft Office 365 GCC High holds a FedRAMP High JAB
  P-ATO under package MSO365MT
  (marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/MSO365MT). The JAB P-ATO
  pathway is defunct for new authorizations, but existing
  P-ATOs remain in force.
- Microsoft Office 365 GCC holds a FedRAMP Moderate
  authorization; verify current package identifier at
  marketplace.fedramp.gov.
- Microsoft Office 365 Commercial holds a FedRAMP High P-ATO
  on specific services.

**DoD Impact Level posture (verified 2026-04-21).** Microsoft
365 GCC High holds DoD IL2, IL4, and IL5 Provisional
Authorizations under CSP SRG v1r1 reciprocity rules. IL5
requires FedRAMP High baseline (a change from retired CC SRG
v1r4); Microsoft 365 GCC High's FedRAMP High P-ATO is the
baseline on which the IL5 PA sits. Microsoft 365 GCC holds
DoD IL2. Microsoft 365 DoD holds IL5 under separate DoD-
exclusive authorization.

**Per-service authorization verification pattern.** The per-
service authorization scope (which specific Office 365
services are in FedRAMP / IL scope within each tenancy) is
enumerated at the FedRAMP Marketplace package pages. For M365
GCC High the authoritative source is
marketplace.fedramp.gov/products/MSO365MT. A contractor
building an SSP cites the current package scope and records
the verification date; Microsoft's own public compliance
pages may lag the Marketplace.

**Scope boundary for IL content in this file.** This section
names the tenancy-level authorizations and points at the hub
crosswalk. It does not implement IL4 or IL5 end-to-end. Full
IL4/IL5 implementation detail (CNSSI 1253 overlays beyond
the general framing, NSS controls, workload-category
criteria) is deferred to a future DoD-specific reference per
the forward-reference in `references/fedramp-gap.md`
"Relationship to DoD Cloud Computing Security Requirements
Guide."
