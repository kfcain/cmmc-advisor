# CMMC 2.0 Levels and Assessment

> Source: 32 CFR Part 170 (CMMC Program Final Rule), CMMC Assessment Guide
> (dodcio.defense.gov), NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2

## Overview

The Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) 2.0 program establishes
three certification levels for organizations in the Defense Industrial Base
(DIB). The level required depends on the type of information the contractor
handles and the sensitivity of the contract.

CMMC does not create new cybersecurity requirements. It verifies that
contractors have implemented requirements that have been in place since
DFARS 252.204-7012 was published in 2017. As Summit 7 puts it:
"CMMC isn't making you do the requirements; it's making sure you did the
requirements."

## The Three Levels

### Level 1 — Foundational

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Information type** | Federal Contract Information (FCI) |
| **Practice count** | 17 practices (CMMC Model), codified as 15 security requirements in 32 CFR 170.14(c)(2) |
| **Source standard** | FAR 52.204-21(b)(1) (Basic Safeguarding) |
| **Assessment type** | Annual self-assessment |
| **Assessment body** | Organization itself |
| **Applies to** | All DoD contractors handling FCI |

Level 1 represents basic cyber hygiene: the 17 practices of the CMMC Model,
which the final rule codifies as the 15 basic safeguarding requirements of
FAR 52.204-21(b)(1). Both counts describe the same safeguarding content;
the model counts the three physical-protection activities of FAR paragraph
(b)(1)(ix) (escort visitors, keep physical access logs, control access
devices) as separate practices, while the rule and the CMMC Assessment
Guide Level 1 v2.13 count that paragraph once. Examples include using
passwords, limiting physical access to systems, and updating software.

Under the final rule the requirements carry identifiers keyed to the FAR
clause paragraphs, AC.L1-b.1.i through SI.L1-b.1.xv. Older material and
many industry checklists use the 17-practice numbering (AC.L1-3.1.1
style); see `references/level-1-quickstart.md` for the full mapping
between the two schemes.

**Key point for contractors:** If your contract involves only FCI (not CUI),
Level 1 is sufficient. Self-assessment means no third-party audit. You
assess yourself annually and submit results to the Supplier Performance
Risk System (SPRS).

---

### Level 2 — Advanced

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Information type** | Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) |
| **Practice count** | 110 practices |
| **Source standard** | NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 |
| **Assessment type** | Self-assessment OR C3PAO third-party assessment |
| **Assessment body** | Organization (self) or Certified Third-Party Assessment Organization (C3PAO) |
| **Applies to** | DoD contractors handling CUI |

Level 2 is the most common certification target for DIB contractors. It
requires implementation of all 110 security requirements from NIST SP
800-171 Revision 2, organized across 14 domains.

**Self-assessment vs. C3PAO:**
- **Non-prioritized CUI contracts:** Annual self-assessment permitted
- **Prioritized CUI contracts:** Third-party C3PAO assessment required every three years

The distinction between prioritized and non-prioritized is made by the
DoD program manager in the contract solicitation. DoD has stated that
Level 2 self-assessments are the exception, not the rule; most CUI
contracts will require C3PAO assessment.

> Source: Summit 7 Blog, "DoD Says CMMC Level 2 Self-Assessments Are the
> Exception, Not the Rule"
> https://www.summit7.us/blog/cmmc-l2-self-assessments

**Cost context:**
- Level 2 self-assessment: approximately $37,000–$49,000
- Level 2 C3PAO assessment: approximately $105,000–$118,000

These estimates include preparation, remediation, and assessment fees.
Actual costs vary by organization size, complexity, and current posture.

### Level 3 — Expert

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| **Information type** | CUI for highest-sensitivity programs |
| **Practice count** | 134 practices (110 from 800-171r2 + 24 from 800-172) |
| **Source standard** | NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2 + NIST SP 800-172 |
| **Assessment type** | Government-led assessment |
| **Assessment body** | Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center (DIBCAC) |
| **Applies to** | Contractors on the most sensitive DoD programs |

Level 3 adds 24 enhanced requirements from NIST SP 800-172 on top of the
110 Level 2 requirements. These address advanced persistent threats and
require capabilities like threat hunting, redundancy, and advanced
monitoring.

**Key point:** Level 3 is government-assessed. There is no self-assessment
or third-party option. DIBCAC conducts the assessment directly. This level
applies to a small subset of DIB contractors working on the most sensitive
programs. A Final Level 2 (C3PAO) status on the same scope is a
prerequisite. See `level-3-expert.md` for all 24 enhanced requirements,
DoD-assigned ODPs, Level 3 scoping, and the DIBCAC process.

## The 14 Domains

All 110 Level 2 practices are organized into 14 domains. Each domain
corresponds to a requirement family in NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2:

| Domain | ID | L2 Practices | L1 Requirements (FAR 52.204-21) |
|--------|----|-------------|--------------------------------|
| Access Control | AC | 22 | 4 |
| Awareness and Training | AT | 3 | 0 |
| Audit and Accountability | AU | 9 | 0 |
| Configuration Management | CM | 9 | 0 |
| Identification and Authentication | IA | 11 | 2 |
| Incident Response | IR | 3 | 0 |
| Maintenance | MA | 6 | 0 |
| Media Protection | MP | 9 | 1 |
| Personnel Security | PS | 2 | 0 |
| Physical Protection | PE | 6 | 2 |
| Risk Assessment | RA | 3 | 0 |
| Security Assessment | CA | 4 | 0 |
| System and Communications Protection | SC | 16 | 2 |
| System and Information Integrity | SI | 7 | 4 |
| **Total** | | **110** | **15** |

> Source: CMMC Assessment Guide Level 2 v2.13 and CMMC Assessment Guide
> Level 1 v2.13, dodcio.defense.gov

**Note:** All 110 requirements are assessed at Level 2 under XX.L2-3.x.x
identifiers. The 15 Level 1 requirements are FAR 52.204-21 counterparts of
a subset of them (PE.L1-b.1.ix alone corresponds to three Level 2
requirements: PE.L2-3.10.3, 3.10.4, and 3.10.5). A Level 2 certification
covers everything Level 1 protects, and more.

## Scoring Methodology

### How Scoring Works

Each of the 110 Level 2 practices is assessed as either **MET** or **NOT MET**.

The scoring system assigns point values to each practice per the DoD
Assessment Methodology: 44 practices weigh 5 points, 14 weigh 3 points,
51 weigh 1 point, and the SSP (CA.L2-3.12.4) is special (without one the
assessment cannot be conducted). The maximum score is 110 and the floor
is -203. Only two practices carry partial credit: IA.L2-3.5.3 and
SC.L2-3.13.11. Per-practice values live in
`assessment-objectives/{domain}.md` and
`data/assessment-objectives.json`.

**SPRS scoring:** Organizations calculate their SPRS (Supplier Performance
Risk System) score by starting at 110 and subtracting points for practices
that are NOT MET. The score is submitted to SPRS and is visible to DoD
contracting officers.

### Passing Threshold

- **Full certification:** All 110 practices MET (score of 110)
- **Conditional certification:** Minimum score of 80% with all critical
  practices met and unmet items documented in a POA&M

### Conditional Certification

If an organization achieves at least 80% but does not meet all 110 practices:

1. All practices scored as NOT MET must be **non-critical** (1-point items only) per 32 CFR 170.21
2. One exception per 32 CFR 170.21/170.23: SC.L2-3.13.11 (CUI encryption)
   can be on a POA&M when encryption exists but is not FIPS-validated (the
   3-point-deduction state of a 5-point practice per the DoD Assessment
   Methodology v1.2.1 partial-credit structure)
3. All NOT MET items must be documented in a Plan of Action & Milestones (POA&M)
4. All POA&M items must be closed within **180 days** per 32 CFR 170.21
5. A POA&M **closeout assessment** must verify remediation. **Who** performs it
   depends on the assessment path (32 CFR 170.21(b)): Level 2 **(Self)** → the
   OSA performs a closeout self-assessment; Level 2 **(C3PAO)** → an authorized
   or accredited C3PAO; Level 3 **(DIBCAC)** → DCMA DIBCAC

**If the 180-day deadline is missed:** Conditional status expires. The
organization loses its certification and must re-assess.

> Explained: What You Can and Cannot Defer"
> https://isidefense.com/blog/cmmc-poams-explained-what-you-can-and-cannot-defer

### Practices That Cannot Be on a POA&M

**Point-value rule:** Except for the SC.L2-3.13.11 FIPS carve-out above, POA&M
items may not have a scoring point value greater than 1 (32 CFR 170.21(a)(2)(ii)).

**Explicit L2 bans (even if 1-point):** 32 CFR 170.21(a)(2)(iii) prohibits placing
any of the following on a Level 2 POA&M:

| Practice | Short name (regulatory) |
|----------|-------------------------|
| AC.L2-3.1.20 | External Connections (CUI Data) |
| AC.L2-3.1.22 | Control Public Information (CUI Data) |
| CA.L2-3.12.4 | System Security Plan |
| PE.L2-3.10.3 | Escort Visitors (CUI Data) |
| PE.L2-3.10.4 | Physical Access Logs (CUI Data) |
| PE.L2-3.10.5 | Manage Physical Access (CUI Data) |

Level 3 has a separate prohibited list under 32 CFR 170.21(a)(3)(ii) (selected
800-172 enhanced requirements). Do not plan Conditional Certification around
deferring these items.

## Assessment Process

### Level 1 Self-Assessment

1. Organization reviews all 15 Level 1 requirements (AC.L1-b.1.i through
   SI.L1-b.1.xv)
2. Assesses each requirement as MET, NOT MET, or NOT APPLICABLE per
   32 CFR 170.24
3. Documents results
4. Submits SPRS score
5. Senior official affirms the assessment with a signed affirmation
6. Repeat annually

**Important:** The affirmation carries legal weight. A senior official is
attesting under penalty of law that the assessment is accurate. This is
not a checkbox exercise.

### Level 2 C3PAO Assessment

1. Organization prepares by implementing all 110 practices and documenting
   them in a System Security Plan (SSP)
2. Organization selects a C3PAO from The Cyber AB (formerly the CMMC Accreditation Body; rebranded 2022)
   marketplace
3. C3PAO conducts assessment:
   - Reviews SSP and supporting documentation
   - Examines evidence of practice implementation
   - Interviews personnel
   - Observes controls in operation
4. C3PAO issues assessment report
5. Results submitted to CMMC eMASS (Enterprise Mission Assurance Support Service)
6. Certification valid for three years (if fully certified) or 180 days
   (if conditional)

### Level 3 DIBCAC Assessment

1. Organization must first hold a Level 2 C3PAO certification
2. DIBCAC conducts the Level 3 assessment directly
3. Assesses the 24 additional practices from NIST SP 800-172
4. Government-led process with no third-party option

## Phased Rollout Timeline

CMMC implementation follows a four-phase rollout defined in **32 CFR 170.3(e)**.
Phase 1 begins on the effective date of the **48 CFR (DFARS) CMMC acquisition
rule** (not the 32 CFR program rule alone). The program rule (32 CFR Part 170)
became effective **December 16, 2024** and established the model and assessment
framework; contractual phase-in starts with the acquisition rule.

| Phase | Date | What Happens |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Program rule effective | December 16, 2024 | 32 CFR Part 170 effective. Model, assessments, and C3PAO ecosystem codified. **Not** the start of phased contract implementation under 170.3(e). |
| Phase 1 | November 10, 2025 | 48 CFR acquisition rule effective. DoD may include CMMC status requirements (often Level 1 (Self) and Level 2 (Self) emphasis in early implementation) in applicable solicitations at program-office discretion (COTS-only awards excepted). |
| Phase 2 | November 10, 2026 | One year after Phase 1. Broader inclusion of Level 2 **(C3PAO)** certification requirements for applicable CUI contracts, per phased implementation. |
| Phase 3 | November 10, 2027 | One year after Phase 2. Further expansion, including Level 3 **(DIBCAC)** requirements where designated. |
| Phase 4 | November 10, 2028 | Full implementation: CMMC requirements in applicable DoD solicitations/contracts (and option periods) where FCI/CUI is processed, stored, or transmitted (COTS-only excepted). See DFARS 204.7504. |

> Source: 32 CFR 170.3(e); DFARS Case 2019-D041 final rule effective November 10,
> 2025 (48 CFR Parts 204/212/217/252); DFARS 252.204-7021; DFARS 204.7504.
> Practitioner summaries: Arnold & Porter / Skadden CMMC DFARS advisories (2025).

**Current status (June 2026):** Phase 1 is underway (started November 10, 2025).
CMMC clauses and status requirements are appearing in new DoD solicitations
where program offices include them. Phase 2 (broader Level 2 C3PAO emphasis)
begins **November 10, 2026**. Always confirm the CMMC level and assessment
type in the specific solicitation.

## Key Takeaways for Contractors

1. **Determine your level now.** Review your contracts and solicitations for
   CMMC level requirements. If you handle CUI, plan for Level 2.

2. **Start with scoping.** Define your CUI boundary before implementing
   controls. See `scoping-and-cui.md` for guidance.

3. **Self-assessment scores matter today.** Even before C3PAO assessment,
   your SPRS score is visible to contracting officers and affects contract
   eligibility.

4. **Budget for the assessment.** C3PAO assessments are a significant cost.
   Build this into your contract pricing and business planning.

5. **The 180-day clock is real.** If you pursue conditional certification,
   you must close all POA&M items within 180 days or lose certification.
   See `poam-management.md` for strategies.

6. **Primes set the pace.** Your prime contractor's CMMC requirements flow
   down to you. Engage early with your prime to understand their timeline
   and expectations.
